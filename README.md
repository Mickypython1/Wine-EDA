# Wine-EDA

# Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the WineQT dataset, which includes physicochemical properties of wine samples along with their quality ratings. The goal of this project is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that can guide further modeling and predictive analysis.

# Objectives
Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates).

Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

Visualize distributions, correlations, and outliers.

Understand how features like alcohol, acidity, and sulphates influence wine quality.

Prepare the dataset for machine learning models.

# Steps in EDA
1. Data Import & Inspection
Load dataset using pandas.

Check shape, column names, and data types.

Identify missing values and duplicates.

2. Univariate Analysis
Bar plots for wine quality distribution.

Kernel density plots for feature distributions.

Swarm plots to detect outliers.

3. Bivariate Analysis
Pair plots to visualize relationships between variables.

Violin plots for alcohol vs. quality.

Box plots to examine variability and outliers.

4. Multivariate Analysis
Correlation heatmap to identify strong positive/negative relationships.

Insights into how multiple features collectively influence wine quality.
